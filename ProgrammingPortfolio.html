<h5>The game takes place in a village of Emblem that's been ravaged by bandits, and the player must defeat them in order to collect the stolen items.</h5>
<h2>Adopt a Robot:</h2>
<p>This application allows the player to create and name their own robot. The player's robot name is saved as well as the color of the robot.</p>
<h6>A coding example:</h6>
<pre><code>        Console.WriteLine("Welcome to Adopt a Robot!");
        Console.WriteLine("What is your name?");
        player.Name = Console.ReadLine();
</code></pre>
<h2>Tip Calculator:</h2>
<p>This program creates a calculator that calculates the player's tip after gaining the total cost.</p>
<h2>Trivia Game:</h2>
<p>My trivia game prints multiple questions, only until the player types the correct answers will they be able to proceed.</p>
<h2>Retrival WPF:</h2>
<p>Using a WPF application I was able to create a visual representation of my former Console project. It uses buttons, radio buttons, text blocks for player input, progressbars as health bars that decrease when the player takes damage.</p>
